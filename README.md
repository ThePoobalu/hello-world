# hello-world
This is my first repository on GitHub.

For the sake of learning the commit process, I will not be formatting this document with a markup or programming language.
Currently I am in the process of teaching myself to code, and part of that journey is learning Git and GitHub.
This is all very exciting and I can't wait to bringing my ideas to life!
